## \[Finance\] \[251121\] In-depth Analysis of the US Stock Market on November 20, 2025: A 'Perfect Storm' Triggered by AI

**Publication Date**: November 21, 2025

### Executive Summary

On November 20, 2025, the U.S. stock market experienced a dramatic "open-high, close-low" reversal. Spurred by a better-than-expected earnings report from Artificial Intelligence (AI) giant Nvidia, the market opened significantly higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging over 700 points at its peak. However, the optimism was short-lived. The market sentiment shifted abruptly in the afternoon, leading to a sharp sell-off across the board, with technology stocks leading the decline. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite hit their lowest closing levels in over two months, and the S&P 500 underwent its most severe intraday reversal since April. This decline was not triggered by a single factor but was a "perfect storm" resulting from a combination of deep-seated anxiety about the return on AI investments, a sudden drop in expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut, technical selling, and multiple market uncertainties.

### Event Panorama: From Euphoria to Collapse

The market's trajectory for the day centered on AI giant Nvidia. After the previous day's market close, Nvidia reported third-quarter earnings that far exceeded market expectations and provided a strong sales forecast for the fourth quarter. CEO Jensen Huang expressed strong confidence in the future of AI [3]. This news significantly boosted market sentiment, driving U.S. stocks to open sharply higher on November 20, with the Nasdaq Composite soaring nearly 2.5% in early trading.

However, the reversal began quietly in the afternoon. Nvidia's stock, which had been up as much as 5%, took a sharp downturn, ultimately closing with a loss of over 3%. The fall of this market pillar quickly triggered a chain reaction. The entire semiconductor sector plummeted by 4.8%, and technology stocks became the epicenter of the sell-off. The intraday trading range for both the Dow and the Nasdaq exceeded 1,000 points, with the Nasdaq recording its largest intraday swing of 4.9 percentage points since the tariff turmoil in April [1]. The wave of selling spread throughout the market, leading to all three major indices closing in the red.

### In-depth Causal Analysis: A Confluence of Headwinds

#### 1. The 'Soul-Searching' of AI Investment: Profitability and Valuation Bubbles

Despite Nvidia's stellar earnings, the market did not fully embrace the news. Instead, it triggered deep-seated concerns about whether the massive investments in the AI sector could generate corresponding profits. This anxiety was not unfounded. Renowned investor Michael Burry, the protagonist of "The Big Short," posted a series of sharp critiques on social media regarding the business models of the AI industry [4].

> Burry argued that "just because something is used does not mean it is profitable." He questioned the existence of extensive "give-and-take deals" among AI companies to support an artificial boom and pointed out that companies like Nvidia were embellishing their financial statements through accounting practices such as extending the depreciation periods of their assets. He even asked directly: "OpenAI is the linchpin here. Can anyone name their auditor?" [4]

This perspective resonated with traders. Matt Maley, Chief Market Strategist at Miller Tabak, noted, "Can AI truly achieve the level of profitability priced in by the market? That is the key question. Traders are worried about whether today's AI investments will be profitable in five years, so they've decided to take some profits off the table." [5] The spread of this sentiment was the direct catalyst that turned tech stocks, led by Nvidia, from heroes to villains.

#### 2. Plummeting Fed Rate Cut Expectations: Strong Jobs Data 'Backfires'

The September non-farm payrolls report, delayed for weeks by the government shutdown, came in surprisingly strong, with 119,000 jobs added, far exceeding the expected 50,000 [1][2]. This "stale" data became another straw that broke the market's optimistic back. The robust employment figures significantly reduced market expectations for a third interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in December.

According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a December rate cut plummeted from a near-certainty of 97% in mid-October to less than 40% on November 20 [6]. Institutions like Morgan Stanley quickly adjusted their forecasts, stating that the Fed would likely pause its rate cuts in December [2]. This reversal in interest rate expectations dealt a direct blow to growth-oriented technology stocks, which rely on a low-interest-rate environment, by increasing their financing costs and reducing investors' risk appetite.

#### 3. Technical and Structural Factors: Deleveraging and Programmatic Selling

The market's sharp reversal was also closely linked to technical and structural factors. Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna International Group, pointed out that with two major catalysts—Nvidia's earnings and Fed rate cut expectations—now in the rearview mirror, investors began to question what could drive a year-end rally. This made the net-long positions of systematic strategies like Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) "vulnerable," potentially triggering large-scale programmatic selling once a market correction began [5].

Furthermore, the market's "breadth" was poor. Even as the main indices rose in the morning, the number of declining stocks far outpaced advancing ones, indicating that the rally lacked a broad foundation. Additionally, the sharp sell-off in the cryptocurrency market exacerbated risk-off sentiment. Bitcoin's price fell below $87,000 to a multi-month low, which was seen as a signal of deleveraging among retail investors—a group that had been a significant force behind the market's earlier rise [2][5].

#### 4. The Aftermath of the Government Shutdown: Uncertainty in a Data 'Black Hole'

The 43-day U.S. federal government shutdown caused an unprecedented disruption in the release of economic data. Although the government has since reopened, key economic data for October (such as employment and inflation reports) will be combined with the November report and released after the Fed's December meeting [7]. This means the Fed will have to make its decisions with incomplete information. This "data black hole" has greatly increased market uncertainty, causing any minor disturbance to be amplified and exacerbating market volatility.

### Conclusion

The major reversal in the U.S. stock market on November 20, 2025, was a classic stampede from a peak of optimistic expectations to a grim reality. Nvidia's earnings report, which should have been a shot in the arm for the market, unexpectedly became a litmus test for investors to scrutinize the returns on AI investments. When deep-seated valuation anxieties converged with a macroeconomic reversal in interest rate expectations, technical programmatic selling, and uncertainty from a data vacuum, a violent market correction became inevitable. This serves as a warning to investors that in a market driven by a single narrative (such as AI), any wavering in the foundation of that narrative can trigger a disproportionately severe and volatile reaction.
